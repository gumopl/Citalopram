Moreover, abnormalities in electrolyte levels (such as potassium and magnesium) may also increase the risk of abnormalities in the heartbeat of people suffering from heart problems. Such people must have an ECG review, before as well as during treatment with Citalopram. However, the final decision will be only made by your doctor, after analyzing your health condition and considering all possible risks and benefits of this medicine.
